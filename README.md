<h2>Project for COMP 2084 - Server-Sider Scripting with ASP.NET</h2>
<p>This web app will allow users to track their progress in television series across streaming services, cableTV or DVD/Blu-Ray Disc</p>

<h3>Assignment 1B</h3>
<p>The project has been created, scaffolded and stylized.</p>
<p>The 3 Tables are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><h5>Shows:</h5>The main focus of this App is to track the shows, how many episodes, and the current place in the series, this table does just that</li>  
  <li><h5>Services:</h5>Shows are found and watched in a variety of ways, tracking these servcies - be they physical or digital - is important to coordinating watching a show</li>  
  <li><h5>CoWatchers:</h5>People like to watch shows with friends/family, allowing them to track the people they watch shows with seems like a valuable feature</li>  
</ul>
